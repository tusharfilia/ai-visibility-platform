**Justification:**
- Core systems (entity-evidence, citation classification, engine-aware scoring, maturity model) are fully compliant
- Structural scoring is 95% complete (missing key pages database integration)
- Consensus scoring is basic (60%) - needs fact-level tracking
- Advanced features (E-E-A-T, prompt coverage visualization) are partial

**Gap to 100% Compliance:**
1. Fact-level consensus tracking (-5 points)
2. Full E-E-A-T scoring system (-7 points)
