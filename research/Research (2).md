## **OpenAI (ChatGPT / SearchGPT)**

-   **How it sources**: OpenAI's **SearchGPT prototype** explicitly
    > combines GPT with **web sources** and shows **clear citations**;
    > best features are being merged into ChatGPT. (Historically,
    > ChatGPT browsing has leaned on Bing's index; OpenAI's public
    > statement is that SearchGPT cites current web sources.)
    > ([[OpenAI]{.underline}](https://openai.com/index/searchgpt-prototype/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

-   **Credibility implications\
    > **

    -   If your business is **well-covered by reputable, crawlable
        > sources** (official site with clear info + structured data,
        > GBP/Bing Places, high-quality coverage on authoritative
        > sites), you're more likely to be cited and summarized

## **Perplexity**

-   **How it sources**: Real-time **answer engine** with **inline

    > AI]{.underline}](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/getting-started-with-perplexity?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

-   **Notable behavior**: Source selection can be influenced by domain
    > filters/customization (e.g., partner deployments), and there's
    > ongoing publisher friction about crawling/attribution---so **being
    > in whitelisted/authoritative domains matters a lot**.

## **Anthropic (Claude)**

-   **How it sources**: Claude now supports **Web Search via API** and a
    > **Citations API** for linking answers to sources/RAG
    > documents---designed to reduce confabulations by tying claims to
    > documents.

-   **Credibility implications\
    > **

    -   For public web answers, ensure **authoritative, fetchable
        > pages** exist about your business; for enterprise use,
        > companies can point Claude at **approved corp sources**
        > (SharePoint/OneDrive, etc.), which then become the "trusted"

# **the universal credibility checklist (works across engines)**

1.  **Business listings**:

    -   Fully complete **Google Business Profile** and **Bing Places**;
        > keep NAP identical across the web. Respond to reviews.
        > ([[Google
        > Help]{.underline}](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

2.  **Authoritative coverage & citations**:

    -   Get featured on reputable industry publications, local chambers,
        > data providers, and high-trust directories; earn clean
        > backlinks. ([[Search Engine
        > Land]{.underline}](https://searchengineland.com/bings-search-ranking-factors-relevance-quality-credibility-user-engagement-freshness-location-and-page-load-time-336924?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

3.  **On-site transparency & schema**:

    -   Clear About/Contact/Policies, author bios, service pages with
        > proof (case studies, testimonials), **schema.org
        > Organization/LocalBusiness** with sameAs links, and
        > product/service schema where applicable. (Aligns with E-E-A-T
        > guidance.) ([[Google for
        > Developers]{.underline}](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

4.  **Consistency & freshness**:

    -   Keep hours, menus, pricing, and pages fresh; publish updates and
        > events; add photos/media. Engines reward recency/user
        > engagement. ([[Search Engine
        > Land]{.underline}](https://searchengineland.com/bings-search-ranking-factors-relevance-quality-credibility-user-engagement-freshness-location-and-page-load-time-336924?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

5.  **Technical signals**:

    -   Fast, mobile-friendly pages; no manipulative practices; secure
        > (HTTPS); accessible markup; clean sitemaps. (Bing & Google
        > guidelines). ([[Search - Microsoft
        > Bing]{.underline}](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/webmasters-guidelines-30fba23a?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

6.  **Reputation management**:

    -   Proactively generate and respond to reviews (GBP/Bing), and
        > correct misinformation on high-visibility profiles. ([[Google
        > Help]{.underline}](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# **what this means for GEO (your product strategy)**

-   **Data coverage \> anything**: prioritize automations that **audit &
    > fix GBP/Bing Places**, **inject correct schema**, and
    > **synchronize NAP** across top directories. (Directly mapped to
    > Google/Bing local prominence/credibility.) ([[Google
    > Help]{.underline}](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

-   **Source seeding for LLMs**: generate **publisher-ready briefs** and
    > **press/partner pages** so Perplexity/SearchGPT/Claude
    > consistently find **high-authority citations** about each
    > customer.
    > ([[OpenAI]{.underline}](https://openai.com/index/searchgpt-prototype/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

-   **Evidence packaging**: create on-site **E-E-A-T blocks** (team
    > creds, awards, case studies with external references) +
    > **RAG-friendly docs** for enterprise contexts (PDF one-pagers/FAQ
    > pages Claude can cite). ([[Google for
    > Developers]{.underline}](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

-   **Monitoring**: track which answers/citations appear in
    > Perplexity/ChatGPT/Copilot, then **close gaps** (missing schema,
    > unclaimed listings, lack of third-party coverage).
